# ZeroWasteCut
This project, which integrates precise mass calculations, cutting optimization (nesting), and a profile database, has the potential to evolve far beyond a simple workshop calculator

## 🎯 Target Audience

This application is not designed solely for *“someone with a saw”*.  
It is built for **professionals working with costly linear materials**, where every centimeter of waste translates directly into financial loss.

### 🏭 Small and Medium Metal Fabrication Workshops
Companies manufacturing **gates, fences, and steel structures**, where rising steel prices make material waste a critical cost factor.  
The application enables precise planning of cuts, minimizing scrap and improving material utilization.

### 🪑 Carpenters and Furniture Manufacturers  
Especially those working with **aluminium systems**, such as sliding wardrobes and kitchen fronts.  
High-value profiles demand accurate mass calculations and optimized cutting layouts to maintain margins.

### 🔧 Installation Companies (PV, HVAC)
Teams installing **photovoltaic mounting systems or air-conditioning structures** require reliable cut lists prepared *before* arriving on-site.  
The application supports accurate pre-planning, reducing on-site adjustments and delays.

### 📦 Procurement and Supply Departments
Office-based staff responsible for ordering materials based on missing elements.  
The system allows them to quickly calculate **how many commercial-length bars (e.g. 6 m stock lengths)** must be ordered from suppliers, eliminating guesswork and over-ordering.
